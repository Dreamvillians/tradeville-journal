    <meta name="description" content="Tradeville – The High-Performance Trading Journal Built for Serious Traders
Elevate your edge. Master your psychology. Compound your profits.

Tradeville is not just another trading journal — it’s the most powerful, fastest, and most intelligent performance platform ever built for active traders. Designed from the ground up for speed, precision, and ruthless self-accountability, Tradeville turns raw trade data into actionable, life-changing insights in seconds.

Why Professional Traders Are Switching to Tradeville
✅ Blazing-Fast Sync & Entry
Manual entry in <15 seconds. Lightning-fast broker/sync imports from 150+ brokers & platforms (TradingView, Thinkorswim, MetaTrader 4/5, Interactive Brokers, Bybit, Binance, Coinbase, Tradovate, NinjaTrader, Meta, Webull, Robinhood, and 100+ more). No more CSV hell.

✅ Institutional-Grade Analytics Engine
Real-time P&L, win rate, expectancy, R-multiples, risk-of-ruin, drawdown analysis, trade duration, hold time, profitability by hour/day/week/month, setup, session (Asia/London/NY), and 50+ advanced metrics. See exactly what’s making or costing you money.

✅ Advanced Trade Tagging & Filtering
Unlimited custom tags, mistake categories, strategy labels, and confidence scoring. Filter by any combination instantly. Find every “FOMO long into resistance on Fridays” in one click.

✅ Psychological Edge Intelligence
Exclusive Tilt Meter™, emotional state tracking, behavioral pattern detection, and pre-trade checklist enforcement. Tradeville literally warns you when you’re about to revenge trade or over-size.

✅ Monte Carlo & Risk-of-Ruin Simulator
Run 100,000 simulations on your actual trade history to see real probability of blow-up or 7-figure growth. Know your true edge, not just backtested hope.

✅ Equity Curve Mastery Dashboard
Beautiful, interactive equity curve with rolling Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, and Profit Factor. Compare multiple accounts side-by-side. Export professional-grade reports for investors or tax purposes.

✅ Screenshots & Trade Replay
Drag-and-drop chart screenshots with automatic timestamps and auto-linked entries. Replay every trade session like film study. Never forget why you entered again.

✅ Daily Performance Reviews & AI Coach (Beta)
End-of-day review wizard forces disciplined reflection. Upcoming AI Coach analyzes your journal and delivers brutal, personalized feedback used by top prop firms.

✅ Bank-Level Security & Privacy
All data encrypted at rest and in transit. Zero data selling. Zero ads. Ever.

Built for the 1% Who Actually Get Rich Trading
Retail journals are toys. Tradeville is the weapon used by seven-figure retail traders, funded traders, and proprietary trading firms worldwide.

If you’re still using Excel, Notion, Edgewonk, TraderSync, or TradesViz in 2025— you’re voluntarily trading with one hand tied behind your back.

Join the thousands of serious traders who have already made the permanent switch.
